Title: Adaptive Dropout Imputer (ADImpute)
Version: 2.1.0
Description: This package predicts unmeasured gene expression values from single cell
             RNA-sequencing data (dropout imputation). This R-package combines multiple
             dropout imputation methods, including a novel gene regulatory network-based method.
