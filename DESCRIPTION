Title: Adaptive Dropout Imputer (ADImpute)
Version: 2.1.0
Description: This package predicts unmeasured gene expression values from single
    cell RNA-sequencing data (dropout imputation). ADImpute can combine existing
    imputation mehods and 2 novel ones: an average-based model and a gene
    regulatory network-based model. Currently supported external imputation
    methods are: DrImpute, SAVER. ADImpute can learn the best performing method
    per gene and combine the results from different methods into an ensemble.
