Title: Adaptive Dropout Imputer (ADImpute)
Version: 2.1.0
Description: This package predicts unmeasured gene expression values from single
             cell RNA-sequencing data (dropout imputation). ADImpute combines
             multiple dropout imputation methods, including a novel gene
             regulatory network-based method. Currently supported external
             imputation methods are: DrImpute, SAVER.
