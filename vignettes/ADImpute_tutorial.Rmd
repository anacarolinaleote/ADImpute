```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
devtools::load_all("../")
library(DrImpute)
library(SCRABBLE)
```

Be sure to download the regulatory network file (.rds or .txt) from https://github.com/anacarolinaleote/ADImpute. Provide the full path to the downloaded file:
```{r}
network_path <- paste0(getwd(),"/../network.coefficients.rds")
```

Load demo data and normalize:
```{r}
data("demo_data", package = "ADImpute")
RPM <- NormalizeRPM(demo_data)
WriteTXT(RPM, "RPM.txt")
rpm_path <- paste0(getwd(),"/RPM.txt")
```

Evaluate methods to determine the best performing imputation method for each gene:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
methods_pergene <- EvaluateMethods(data = RPM,
                                   training.ratio = .7,
                                   mask.ratio = .2,
                                   training.only = T,
                                   split.seed = 12,
                                   mask.seed = 34,
                                   type = "count",
                                   cell.clusters = 2,
                                   cores = 1,
                                   cluster.type = "SOCK",
                                   network.path = network_path,
                                   drop.exclude = T)
head(methods_pergene)
```

For each gene, the best performing method is now computed. Next, impute according to best performing method:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
imputed <- Impute(do = "Ensemble",
                  method.choice = methods_pergene,
                  data = RPM,
                  count_path = rpm_path,
                  type = "count",
                  cell.clusters = 2,
                  cores = 2,
                  cluster.type = "SOCK",
                  network.path = network_path,
                  drop.exclude = T)
str(imputed)
```
